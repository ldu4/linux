* Richtek Technology Corporation - RT5033 Flash LED Driver

The RT5033 Flash LED Circuit is designed for one or two LEDs driving
for torch and strobe applications, it provides an I2C software command
to trigger the torch and strobe operation.

There are two LED outputs available - FLED1 and FLED2. Each of them can
control a separate LED or they can be connected together to double
the maximum current for a single connected LED. One LED is represented
by one child node.

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "richtek,rt5033-led".

A discrete LED element connected to the device must be represented by a child
node - see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt.

Required properties for the LED child node:
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- led-sources : device current output identifiers:  0 - FLED1, 1 - FLED2
- led-max-microamp : 12.5mA to 200mA, step by 12.5mA.
- flash-max-microamp :
	Turn on one LED channel : 50mA to 800mA, step by 25mA.
	Turn on two LED channels : 50mA to 600mA, step by 25mA.
- flash-max-timeout-us : 64ms to 1216ms, step by 32ms.

Optional properties for the LED child node:
- label : see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Example:

rt5033 {
	compatible = "richtek,rt5033";

	led {
		compatible = "richtek,rt5033-led";

		flash-led {
			label = "rt5033-flash";
			led-sources = <0>, <1>;
			led-max-microamp = <200000>;
			flash-max-microamp = <800000>;
			flash-max-timeout-us = <1216000>;
		};
	};
}
