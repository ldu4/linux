Simple Power-Managed Bus
========================

A Simple Power-Managed Bus is a transparent bus that doesn't need a real
driver, as it's typically initialized by the boot loader.

However, its bus controller is part of a PM domain, or under the control of a
functional clock.  Hence, the bus controller's PM domain and/or clock must be
enabled for child devices connected to the bus (either on-SoC or externally)
to function.


Generic compatible values and properties
----------------------------------------

Required properties:
  - compatible: Must be at least one of the vendor-specific compatible values
		from a vendor-specific section below, and "simple-bus" as a
		fallback.
  - #address-cells, #size-cells, ranges: Must describe the mapping between
		parent address and child address spaces.

Optional platform-specific properties for clock or PM domain control (at least
one of them is required):
  - clocks: Must contain a reference to the functional clock(s),
  - power-domains: Must contain a reference to the PM domain.


Vendor-specific compatible values and properties
------------------------------------------------

Renesas Bus State Controller (BSC):
  - compatible: Must be an SoC-specific value, and "renesas,bsc" as a fallback.
                SoC-specific values can be:
		"renesas,bsc-r8a73a4" for R-Mobile APE6 (r8a73a4)
		"renesas,bsc-sh73a0" for SH-Mobile AG5 (sh73a0)
  - reg: Must contain the base address and length to access the bus controller.
  - interrupts: Must contain a reference to the BSC interrupt, if available.


Example:

	bsc: bus@fec10000 {
		compatible = "renesas,bsc-sh73a0", "renesas,bsc", "simple-bus";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges = <0 0 0x20000000>;
		reg = <0xfec10000 0x400>;
		interrupts = <0 39 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&zb_clk>;
		power-domains = <&pd_a4s>;
	};
