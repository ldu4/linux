* Samsung Exynos4 Clock Controller

The Exynos4 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various controllers
within the Exynos4 SoC. The clock binding described here is applicable to all
SoC's in the Exynos4 family.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be one of the following.
  - "samsung,exynos4210-clock" - controller compatible with Exynos4210 SoC.
  - "samsung,exynos4412-clock" - controller compatible with Exynos4412 SoC.

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

- #clock-cells: should be 1.

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume.

All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
dt-bindings/clock/exynos4.h header and can be used in device
tree sources.

Example 1: An example of a clock controller node is listed below.

	clock: clock-controller@0x10030000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-clock";
		reg = <0x10030000 0x20000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

Example 2: UART controller node that consumes the clock generated by the clock
	   controller. Refer to the standard clock bindings for information
	   about 'clocks' and 'clock-names' property.

	serial@13820000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-uart";
		reg = <0x13820000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0 54 0>;
		clocks = <&clock CLK_UART2>, <&clock CLK_SCLK_UART2>;
		clock-names = "uart", "clk_uart_baud0";
	};

Exynos4412 SoC contains some additional clocks for FIMC-ISP (Camera ISP)
subsystem. Registers for those clocks are partially located in the SOC area,
which belongs to ISP power domain. Because those registers are also located
in a different memory region than the main clock controller, a separate clock
controller has to be defined for handling them. The compatible string to such
controller is "samsung,exynos4412-isp-clock". It also has two input clocks
from the main Exynos4412 clock controller: "aclk200" and "aclk400_mcuisp".
The ISP clock controller has to be linked with respective ISP power domain
(for more information, see Samsung Exynos power domains bindings).

Example 3: An example of a clock controllers for Exynos4412 SoCs.

	clock: clock-controller@10030000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4412-clock";
		reg = <0x10030000 0x18000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

	isp_clock: clock-controller@10048000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4412-isp-clock";
		reg = <0x10048000 0x1000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		power-domains = <&pd_isp>;
		clocks = <&clock CLK_ACLK200>, <&clock CLK_ACLK400_MCUISP>;
		clock-names = "aclk200", "aclk400_mcuisp";
	};
