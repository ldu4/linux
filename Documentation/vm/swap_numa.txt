If the system has more than one swap device and swap device has the node
information, we can make use of this information to decide which swap
device to use in get_swap_pages() to get better performance.

The current code uses a priority based list, swap_avail_list, to decide
which swap device to use and if multiple swap devices share the same
priority, they are used round robin. This change here replaces the single
global swap_avail_list with a per-numa-node list, i.e. for each numa node,
it sees its own priority based list of available swap devices. Swap
device's priority can be promoted on its matching node's swap_avail_list.

The current swap device's priority is set as: user can set a >=0 value,
or the system will pick one starting from -1 then downwards. The priority
value in the swap_avail_list is the negated value of the swap device's
due to plist being sorted from low to high. The new policy doesn't change
the semantics for priority >=0 cases, the previous starting from -1 then
downwards now becomes starting from -2 then downwards and -1 is reserved
as the promoted value.
